/*Steps to Success
    1. Create Processor
        -Memory = 100 addresses
        -Accumulator - int - Register that operations are preformed upon, data buffer
        -InstructionCounter - stores address of currect instruction to be executed
        -InstructionRegister - stores the current instruction fetched from VM memory
        -OperationCode and Operand - storing decoded components of current instructions
    2. Create two functions
        Compile() - accept written commands as a file
        Execute() - execute what is in memory
    3. Print out Array of ASCII numbers for the different memory addresses
    4. Specific Error Handling
        Compile Errors
        Runtime Errors
        
    5. run commands from a file and get specific results */
